After graduated from my collage, I have worked for 1 year. At this point of my life, I realize that I still need some training to be a better engeer. What I had learned from my collage time is great, but they are not deep enough for me, I want to learn something more advance and with more technology.

Engineer is not just a job for me, but more like a life style. Ever since my high school, I had the dream to be a great engineer, not just because engineers looks cool, but they are to solve practical problems. It is so attractive to me to learn how everything works and how to use them. I am working as a hardware engineer now in a high technology switch compony, designing schematic and test the circuit. It brings me so much sense of accomplishment. To use a lot chips and electronic circuit, our product can provide a company with Internet signals. Everytime when there is problem, I am always willing to find where the problem is 
and why is this happening.

I think graduate program provided me with basic knowledge for electronic circuits, it is helpful for me to do my work.
